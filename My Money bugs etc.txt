TODO
when user changes reconciliation date, remove any items that are AFTER new date. (show alert)

changing recurring amount causes problems with amount available

Integrate with calendar

Tutorial

inserting of new items in reconciliation isn't very smooth and doesn't hilight
entering beginning and ending balance on reconciliations should show commas before editing

editing location at same address more than 3x should render address without location
find a way to sort recurring transactions

When saving as fully reconciled, processing upcoming, saving recurring, need to show progress wheel
When entering amount in transaction, don't want to scroll tableview

Transactions: Show this month and last by default. Add "show more" at bottom to show an additional month at a time

Bugs:
When adding a transition, it subtracts from total available even if the account isn't toward total available.

Reconciliations should automatically add 30 days to last date

Reconciliations shouldn't allow you to add transactions later than reconciliation date
